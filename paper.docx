1) Transaction | Blocks :
     The chain of blocks with transactions, is replaced with various transaction chains.
     Each block is a transaction, Each transaction is a block with its own proof. There 
     is only one transaction in a block, with its own chain.

     Each block is a transaction with its own validation evidences that will allow it
     to be associated with a given chain.

    

2) Transaction Chains: 
     A transaction chain is chain of validated transactions.
 
     A a transaction is linked to the previous transaction cryptograhically, and a new
     transaction can only be added from the last validated transaction  in the chain.

     Each validated transaction is stored as a chain that can only be updated from the 
     last validated transaction in the chain.

     The address of any transaction in the same chain could be used as a destination address,
     it is not necessary to specify the last transaction in the chain

     The first transaction in the chain (i.e genesis) is widely used as
     the reference for the chain

     txn 0(genesis txn) -> txn 1 -> txn 2 -> txn 3 ... -> txn index

3) Different Types of Transaction Chains: 
    #//-Public Smart-Contracts and Decentralized Identity Ledgers
     Chains( UCO wallet),
     Smart-Contract  Transactions Chains,
     Decentralized Identities Transactions Chains for Nodes,
     Transactions chains of the authorized nodes,
     Beacon Chains,
     Oracle Chains,
     Storage Chains,
     Node Chain,
     Network Transactions Chains,
     Keychains,
     Transactions chains of Heuristic Algorithms and software,
